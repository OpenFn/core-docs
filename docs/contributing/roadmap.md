title: Documentation Roadmap
---

[ ] [New page] Foundational Concepts
A page or set of pages that reviews concepts that are essentially prerequisite to using OpenFn or another interoperability platform. 
[ ] [New page] The structure of an integration (title subject to change)
[ ] Envisioned as a primarily visual page that outlines the constituent parts of every integration to equip OpenFn users with a solid grounding of what an integration really is
[ ] [New page] Integrating using OpenFn
[ ] Either a subpage of the structure page or its own page subsequent to; this maps the foundational concepts above to jobs, triggers, runs, etc. We shouldn’t explain those words before we establish a common frame of reference. In some ways this is just an edit of the current Getting Started page.
[ ] [New page] What Does it Mean to be Ready?
Combines current implementation wiki and the various places that data mapping is referenced to do a step-by-step “pre-job-writing” walkthrough 
[ ] [Existing page] Project walk-through
Revise to incorporate the below app-specific tutorials in a cohesive manner
Creation of documentation/tutorial “pathways” for new users and new devs from existing documentation resources to flatten the learning curve
[ ] [Existing page] Quickstart
Rewrite to be dev-centered; should read as a page for users who understand the above already
[ ] [New page] How to integrate CommCare with Salesforce
The Project walkthrough, but specific to these two tools
[ ] [New page] How to integrate DHIS2 and CommCare
[ ] [New page] How to integrate Kobo Toolbox and a custom Postgres database
