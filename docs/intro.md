## OpenFn Documentation

This documentation is for the suite of OpenFn data integration,
interoperability, and automation tools. Note that some technical documentation
and source code for OpenFn's FOSS integration tools and adaptors can also be
found in their respective repositories at
[Github.com/OpenFn](https://github.com/openfn) or see [Deploy](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/deploy/options) 
section for an overview of the FOSS options and additional docs.

Check out the sections on the left. They'll show you how to get up and running,
as well as how to design, build, deploy, and manage data integration and
interoperability projects on OpenFn applications.

Please feel free to point out [issues](https://github.com/openfn/docs/issues)
with this documentation or, if you can't find the right repo, issues with the
tools themselves. (The more feedback the better!). If you want to propose some
new language for the documentation, you can make those changes by clicking the
**"Edit this page"** link at the bottom of any page and submit a pull request!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email
[admin@openfn.org](mailto:admin@openfn.org).
