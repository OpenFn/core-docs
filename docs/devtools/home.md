```

## Up and running

1. Make sure you've got [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (maybe GitBash for
   Windows?)
2. And [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 12 or greater)
3. Run `git clone git@github.com:OpenFn/devtools.git` for SSH or
   `git clone https://github.com/OpenFn/devtools.git`
4. Run `cd devtools`
5. Run `./install.sh ssh` or `./install.sh https` to install core,
   language-common, and language-http

_Note: If you get a "permission denied" message when running `./install.sh`, try
`run chmod +x ./install.sh ` then retry the install command._

To install specific adaptors, run
`./install.sh ${ssh || https} language-${name}`

You can run core from anywhere by using `npm install -g @openfn/core` for a
global install.

## Usage

Execute takes:

1. `-l [language-package].Adaptor`: The adaptor being used
2. `-e [expression.js]:` The expression being tested
3. `-s [state.json]`: The message `data: {...}` and credential
   `configuration: {...}`
4. `-o [output.json]`: The file to which the output will be written

### Bash usage

```sh
~/devtools/core/bin/core execute \
  -l ~/devtools/adaptors/language-http \
  -s ./tmp/state.json \
  -o ./tmp/output.json \
  -e ./tmp/expression.js
```

### The `--test` option

```sh
~/devtools/core/bin/core execute \
  -l ~/devtools/adaptors/language-http \
  -s ./tmp/state.json \
  -o ./tmp/output.json \
  -e ./tmp/expression.js \
  --test
```

This intercepts all HTTP requests and displays the request information for
debugging.

#### `.FakeAdaptor`

Adaptors may provide dummy modules for testing. `language-salesforce` has a
built-in `.FakeAdaptor` which allows a user to test expressions on data without
sending them to a real Salesforce server.

Instead of using `-l ./language-salesforce.Adaptor`, use
`-l./language-salesforce.FakeAdaptor` to test expressions offline:
`./core/bin/core execute -l ./language-salesforce.FakeAdaptor -s ./tmp/state.json -o ./tmp/output.json -e ./tmp/expression.js`

#### Offline testing for other adaptors

For most standard adaptors which make use of HTTP requests, you can add `--test`
to the execute command to intercept all HTTP requests and return a `200`.

## Configure an OpenFn project

You can use YAML project configuration files to define projects both on the
[OpenFn platform](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/deploy/platform) and in
[OpenFn microservice](https://openfn.github.io/microservice/readme.html#content).
Running `./scripts/generate-project.js` helps you build a project config YAML
interactively, adding your triggers, credentials and jobs to the config. You can
read more about the config file
[here](https://openfn.github.io/microservice/readme.html#sample-configuration)

If you choose `monolith` mode, all your job code will be included in the YAML.
In `URI` mode, youâ€™ll get a config file with URI-s to your defined jobs.

## Pre-Requisites

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is required to run jobs and use many
   of the scripts in Devtools.

2. [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is used so that our modern (es9)
   JavaScript can be run on older Node runtimes. To install it and other build
   tools, you might run `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.

3. A basic working knowledge of NodeJs, promises and asynchronous functions is
   essential for writing adaptors.

## Scripts

Devtools comes with a collection of scripts to aid in setting up a development
environment for adaptor work, and include commands to quickly clone a large
number of adaptors, create tarballs of adaptors with only production
dependencies included, etc.

For the kitchen sink, run:

```sh
./install ssh
./scripts/bootstrap npm-install
```

In order to run the scripts, ensure you have cd'd into the project directory and
enter `./scripts/<script-name>`

### bootstrap

Installs all adaptors in `repos` file to the `/adaptors` directory and prepares
the working directory. This needs to be run before running any of the other
scripts. Pass `npm-install` to run npm install for each adaptor also.

`./scripts/bootstrap npm-install` - to clone, set up hooks and npm install in
each `./scripts/bootstrap`- to clone and set up hooks in each

### generate-project.js

`./scripts/generate-project.js` interactively generates a YAML project
configuration file that can be used both on the OpenFn platform and in OpenFn
microservice to define projects.

### generate-doclets

Iterates overs all language pack folder names found in the `repos` list and
creates a doclet json file in the `doclets` directory.

### analyse-doclets

Iterates overs all doclets found in `doclets` and gives a tree view of the
doclet structure using [jsdoc-query](https://github.com/OpenFn/jsdoc-query).

### bundle

Creates a tarball with all production dependencies install for a given module.

Example: `./scripts/bundle-node language-common -o builds` creates a
`language-common-v1.0.0.tgz` file in the 'builds' directory.

Arguments `./scripts/bundle-node <language> -o <output folder> -d`

- `-o` - Output folder
- `-d` - Debug
- `--no-ast` - Don't build an include an AST for OpenFn.org to parse

### bundle-all

Runs `bundle` for all repos found in the list, and outputs them to the `builds`
folder.

### upload-release

Uploads a tarball to a Github release.

Example:

```
GH_TOKEN=<oauth-token> \
  ./scripts/upload-release -i ./builds/language-common-v0.0.0.tgz
```

Infers the repo name and version number from the file.

Arguments `./scripts/upload-release -i <file> [-u]`

- `i` - Path to build file to upload
- `u` - Update a file if already exists (and is a different size)

## Releasing a new adaptor version for production use

1. **Bump the version in `package.json`**
2. **Run `npm install`** to update `package-lock.json`
3. **Commit** and tag your version with `git tag`. _N.B., this is handled with a
   git hook provided by `bootstrap`_
4. **Push the commits and tag to GitHub** with `git push && git push --tags`
5. **Create a release** on the the associated repo on Github, selecting the
   version tag that was pushed in the last step. Write a title and release notes
   as needed then click 'Publish release'.
6. **Return to the devtools directory** with `cd ../../`
7. **Bundle the module** with
   `./scripts/bundle-node ./adaptors/<language-pack> -o builds`
8. **Verify that the tarball was created** in `builds` with the naming
   convention of: `<language-pack>-<version>.tgz`
9. **Upload the build** using the `upload-release` script:
   `./scripts/upload-release -i builds/<file>`

If the wrong file was uploaded or you want to replace the build on Github then
use the `-u` flag which deletes the build from Github if the filesize is
different.

Note that this script expects a `GH_TOKEN` env variable, which is an OAuth2
token you must get from Github (via the account page)

## Using a new adaptor in an OpenFn/platform instance

1. Add your release to the `scripts/install-lp` script.
2. Add the version number to `priv/adaptors.json`.
3. Add the `bodySchema` to `CredentialView.js`.
